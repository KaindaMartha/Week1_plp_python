Hey there
Welcome to my portfolio, a growing digital space where I showcase my journey in tech. As a beginner passionate about front-end development, design, and entrepreneurship, I use this site to document what I'm learning and building one step at a time.

Outside of tech, I enjoy drawing, exploring digital art, watching documentaries, and reading books that spark curiosity and creativity.

Website Structure and Features
Sticky Navigation Bar
At the top of the site is a fixed navigation bar giving users easy access to the Home, About, Portfolio, Services, and Contact sections regardless of their scroll position.

About Me Section
This section introduces who I am and what I do. It features a dynamic skills list with simple hover animations to make exploring my current tech stack more engaging.

Services Section
An overview of areas I’m currently exploring and hope to offer in the future such as interface design, responsive layouts, and collaborative development.

Portfolio Section
Currently a placeholder, this area will grow to include posters, mini applications, and experimental projects that reflect my progress in web design and user experience.

Contact Form (Coming Soon)
There is a form section designed for future use. I plan to integrate it with backend tools like Node.js and Express.js so users can reach me directly.

Footer Section
A simple call-to-action footer containing links and motivational closing lines that encourage collaboration and connection.

Future Enhancements
I’m actively learning backend development and plan to integrate features such as message handling using Express.js and MongoDB, a working contact form, and user login functionality for collecting project feedback.

Responsive Design
The website is mobile-responsive with key breakpoints that adapt to tablets and smaller screens. In future updates I plan to add a hamburger-style menu for better mobile navigation.
